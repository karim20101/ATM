# ATM
# Application description
 - Three push buttons are connected to microcontroller.
 - Each pushbutton controls one of these processes(login ,registration,and deposit).
 - Login process is responsible for taking  username and password from the user and search for them in the database(EEPROM).
 - Registration process is responsible for allowing the user to set his username and password in the database.
 - Deposit process makeS the user deposit funds in his account.
 - After the user login successfully, this allows him to make some processes like(withdrawal & inquiry). 

# Used components & tools
 - ATmega32 microcontroller
